        <h2>We Help at Major League Hacking and Participate in Global Hacking Week</h2>
        <p>We hang around the Discord Major League Hackers server and help 
            people with their questions about Global Hack Week.</p>

        <h2>We Made a Discord Channel</h2>
        <p>We made a channel called <em>Code, Hack, and Co</em>, where we could
             talk about subjects forbidden in the MLH server where we met. We 
             also thought that it would be a good place to talk and share our 
             screens within a more secluded voice channel.</p>
        <p>In our channel we discovered that we share a love of IOT devices and decided that we would
            both like to work through the book <em>Linux Basics for Hackers by OccupyTheWeb</em>.

        <h2>We Made a Website</h2>
        <p>Malik made a website to help people in the MLH Discord server. He used HTML and asked
            people to help create the styling for it as an open source project for Global Hack Week. 
            With a helpful hand from Alberto and VRX, we used Git and GitHub to collaborate on 
            the project.</p>

        <h2>We Made Discord Bots Together</h2>
        <p>We decided to learn how to make Discord bots together. We watched <a href="https://youtu.be/2k9x0s3awss" 
            target="_blank">this YouTube video</a> and cobbled together a bot that could respond to a few commands. 
            We learned how to use the Discord API and how to use the Python programming language to make a bot that 
            could respond to commands. We learned how to use the <code>discord.py</code> library to make the bot. 
            After watching the YouTube video, <a href="https://realpython.com/how-to-make-a-discord-bot-python/" 
            target="_blank">this was a good resource</a>. The next task would be to learn how to make the bot run
            on a server so that it could be used by others. Watch
